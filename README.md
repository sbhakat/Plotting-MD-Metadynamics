# Plotting-MD-Metadynamics

In this repo I will present how to plot time-series data, free energy profiles from molecular dynamics (MD) and metadynamics (MetaD) simulations.
This project was inspired by:
1. https://github.com/AfroditiMariaZaki/FunnelMetadynamicsAnalysis/blob/master/GlyRMetaD.ipynb and
2. https://notebook.community/UWPRG/Python/tutorials/MetaD%20countours

Software requirements:
1. MDAnalysis
2. MSMBuilder
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Python

Please open up an issue if you want to contribute with new examples and have suggestions to improve the quality of plots.
